1. find the second highest salary of an employee?
SELECT max(SAL)
FROM EMP
WHERE SAL NOT IN (SELECT max(SAL) FROM EMP);

2. Display the highest payed employees in each department
SELECT DEPNO, max(SAL)
FROM EMP 
GROUP BY DEPNO;

display the number of employees in each department
SELECT DEPNO, count(*)
FROM EMP 
GROUP BY DEPNO;

3. display alternate records in sql
SELECT * 
From EMP;

SELECT rownum, EMPNO, SAL, ENAME 
FROM EMP
ORDER BY SAL DESC;

// subquery
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT EMPNO, SAL, ENAME, rownum rn
        FROM EMP
        ORDER BY rn
)
WHERE rn % 2 != 0;

4. find duplicated values and its frequency of a column
SELECT ename, count(*)
FROM emp 
GROUP BY ename;
HAVING count(*) > 1;

SELECT ename, count(*)
FROM emp 
GROUP BY ename;
ORDER BY count(*);

5. Pattern matching in SQL(Basics), LIKE operator
eg: display the employee names whose name start with 'M'
SELECT ename
FROM emp
WHERE ename LIKE 'M%';

eg: display the employee names whose name ends with 'N'
SELECT ename
FROM emp
WHERE ename LIKE '%N';

eg: display the names of all employees having 'M' in any position in their name
SELECT ename
FROM emp
WHERE ename LIKE '%M%';

eg: display the names of all employees whose name does not contain 'M' anywhere
SELECT ename
FROM emp
WHERE ename NOT LIKE '%M%';

6. Pattern matching in SQL(Session 2), LIKE operator
eg: display names of all employees whose name contains exactly 4 letter
SELECT ename
FROM emp
WHERE ename LIKE '____';


eg: display the names of employees whose name contains the 
(i) second letter as 'L'
(ii) fourth letter as 'M'

SELECT ename
FROM emp
WHERE ename LIKE '_L%';

SELECT ename
FROM emp
WHERE ename LIKE '___M%';

eg: display the employee names and hire dates for the employees 
joined in the month of December

SELECT ename, hiredate
FROM emp
WHERE ename LIKE '%DEC%';


eg: display the names of employees whose name contains exactly 2 'L's

SELECT ename
FROM emp
WHERE ename LIKE '%LL%';

eg: display the names of employees whose name starts with 'J' and ends with 'S'

SELECT ename
FROM emp
WHERE ename LIKE 'J%S';

7. display nth row in sql
eg: display 2nd row of emp table; display 4th row of emp table
SELECT * 
FROM emp
WHERE rownum <= 4
minus
SELECT * 
FROM emp
WHERE rownum <= 3

// second way
SELECT * 
FROM (SELECT rownum r, ename, sal
        FROM emp
        WHERE r = 4;
)

SELECT * 
FROM (SELECT rownum r, emp.*
        FROM emp
)
WHERE r = 4;

eg: display 2nd, 3rd, 7th records

SELECT * 
FROM (SELECT rownum r, emp.*
        FROM emp
)
WHERE r in (2, 3, 7);
